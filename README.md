# Week-1-Sustainable-AI-for-Water-Resource-Management
This repository contains my Week 1 project on Sustainable AI for Water Resource Management. It includes dataset.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Water scarcity and mismanagement are critical issues in urban India. 
>>>>This project aims to:

1. Collect and simulate city-wise water demand and supply data.

2 .Analyze potable vs non-potable water availability.

3 .Explore rainwater harvesting, recycled water usage, and groundwater depletion trends.

4 .Build Machine Learning models to predict demand and optimize distribution.

5 .Provide insights for sustainable water management policies.

>>><<<  DatasetDescription >>>><<<<

The dataset contains city and area-wise water usage statistics with the following columns:

1. City  ---->	Urban city name (Hyderabad, Mumbai, etc.)
2. Area	Local ----> area/zone within the city
3. Population  ---->	Estimated population in the area
4. Daily_Demand_MLD	---->Total daily water demand (in Million Liters per Day)
5. Potable_Available_MLD	---->Drinking water available
6. NonPotable_Available_MLD----> Non-drinking water available
7. Recycled_Usage_MLD ---->	Recycled water usage
8. Rainwater_Harvest_MLD	----->Rainwater harvested
9. Groundwater_Level_m	----->Average groundwater depth (in meters)
10. Energy_Consumption_kWh ----->	Energy used in water treatment & supply
11. Water_Loss_%	-----> Water lost in distribution (%)
